## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving world of e-commerce, delivering personalized shopping experiences is crucial for customer satisfaction and retention. This recommendation system utilizes advanced algorithms to analyze user interactions and provide tailored product suggestions, thereby enhancing the overall shopping experience.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Analyzes user behavior to suggest products that align with individual preferences.
- **Real-time Processing**: Delivers instant recommendations based on current user interactions.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large datasets and support numerous users simultaneously.
- **User-Friendly API**: Provides a RESTful API for seamless integration with various front-end platforms.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: FastAPI - A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL - A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.
- **Machine Learning**: Utilizes algorithms for behavior analysis and recommendation generation.
- **Containerization**: Docker - Ensures consistent environments across development and production.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/venkat-0706/ecommerce-recommendation.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd ecommerce-recommendation
   ```

3. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'env\Scripts\activate'
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Configure the Database**:

   - Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running.
   - Create a new database named `ecommerce_db`.
   - Update the `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` file with your database credentials.

6. **Run Database Migrations**:

   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

7. **Start the Application**:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

The API will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Usage

After setting up and running the application:

- **API Documentation**: Access interactive API docs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` for testing endpoints and understanding request/response structures.

- **Integrating with Frontend**: Use the provided API endpoints to fetch recommendations and display them on your e-commerce platform's frontend.
